Given that Vrite is an open-source project, you can get started by either [self-hosting](https://app.vrite.io/self-hosting/introduction) it or using the [Vrite Cloud](https://app.vrite.io/auth) instance (it’s [free](https://vrite.io/pricing/) while Vrite is in Beta).

## Sign In

Whatever way you choose to use Vrite, you’ll be first met with the sign-in page. Here you can do one of the following:

- **Sign up** by clicking _I don’t have an account_ and providing your new username, in addition to a unique email and password; You’ll be sent a link to confirm your email address and finalize the process.
- **Sign in** or sign up via GitHub by clicking the _GitHub_ button and going through the OAuth process;
- Sign in using the email and password form;
- Sign in using the _Magic Link_, by providing an email to which a sign-in link will be sent to. It’s also useful when you _forget your password_ (once you’re in, you can change it in the settings).

To easily navigate around Vrite, you need to get to know the 3 main parts of the UI:

- **Sidebar** - used to navigate between different sections of the UI;
- **Side panel** - where most side activities like configuration, metadata editing, and team management take place; You can easily **resize** or even **collapse** it entirely by dragging its right-side border;
- **Main view** - the largest area of the viewport, focused primarily on content management (via Kanban dashboard) and editing (in the WYSIWYG editor);

### Sidebar

The sidebar is used as the primary means of navigation around Vrite UI. It’s visibly separated into two sections.

**Top section** - Contains the options that let you navigate both the main view and the side panel:

- _Dashboard_ — Takes you to a Kanban dashboard and opens a metadata side panel (if a content piece is opened);
- _Editor_ — Takes you to the Vrite editor and opens the metadata side panel, loading the opened content piece in both;

**Bottom section** - Contains options for navigating the side panel or going to other parts of Vrite UI.

- _Source control _— Opens the Git sync side panel;
- _Settings_ — Opens the settings side panel;
- _Extensions_ — Opens the extensions side panel;
- _Switch Workspace_ — Navigates to Workspace selection menu;
- _Profile_ — Open the profile dropdown displaying details of the signed-in user and other options;

**Profile menu** contains useful information and options like:

- Profile card - Displays user’s profile image and username, alongside a _Logout_ button;
- _Help_ - Opens the _Welcome_ side panel with helpful links;
- _GitHub_ and _Discord_ - links to Vrite repository and community on respective platforms, for quickly getting help or reporting bugs;

### Using Workspaces

The Workspace selection menu allows you to switch between different workspaces.

From here you can see a list of all the Workspaces you’re a member of, with recognizable information like their **name**, **logo**, and **your role** in them.

You can also create a new one by clicking the _New Workspace_ button in the top-right corner.

![Creating a new Workspace](https://assets.vrite.io/6409e82d7dfc74cef7a72e0d/DfTQ8et6exZUd7bVViHYE.png)

Provide a name for the new Workspace and optionally a description and a logo. Then click _Create Workspace_ in the top-right corner and select the newly-created Workspace from the list to switch to it.
